# Swingame-Rover
## C# Swingame Rover Game

### Controls

- **TAB:** Selects next rover, Selected rover indicated by red outline
- **Number (1-9):** Selects corresponding device, Selected device indicated by blue text
- **r:** Outputs rover status, including attached devices and extracted specimens, to the console.
- **a:** Attaches selected device to best available battery

### How to open / run
I'm using the most recent (as of 10th May 2018) MacOS build of Swingame (downloadable from [The Swingame Website](http://www.swingame.com/ "Swingame's Homepage")) to implement the gui, I'm fairly certain for Linux/Windows you'd have to create your own project file with a compatable Swingame Install.

####*Initial UML Class Diagram*

Initially my first class diagram looked like this

This first class diagram was before I decided to use Swingame as my GUI hence the lack of graphic related fields/methods.

Currently am working on an updated version as of course I didn't get it perfect the first time and had to update it as I progressed.
